// 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III 
// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
// Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.
// Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

// Example 1:

// Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
// Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

// Example 2:

// Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
// Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

// Example 3:

// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

 
// Constraints:

//     1 <= prices.length <= 105
//     0 <= prices[i] <= 105


// Time Complexity: O(n) 100ms
// Space Complexity: O(1) 49.5MB
