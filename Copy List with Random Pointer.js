// 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
// A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.
// Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
// For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.
// Return the head of the copied linked list.


// Solution: Hashmap

// A useful feature of the JavaScript Map is that the keys can be of any value (including functions, objects, or any primitive),
// as opposed to the Object, which only accepts strings and symbols as keys.
// The Map comes in handy for this problem as we can set a list node as a key.

// Traverse the linked list, create a new node and save in a map for every node.
  // format: {list node: new list node, list node: new list node, ...}
// Traverse the linked list again, set the next and random pointers of each node based on what's saved in the map.
// Return the node mapped to head.

// Time Complexity: O(n) 60ms
// Space Complexity: O(n) 40.2MB

var copyRandomList = function(head) {
    let node = head, map = new Map();
    while (node) {
      map.set(node, new Node(node.val));
      node = node.next;
    }
    node = head;
    while (node) {
      let copyNode = map.get(node);
      copyNode.next = map.get(node.next) || null;
      copyNode.random = map.get(node.random) || null;
      node = node.next;
    }
    return map.get(head);
  };

// Input: 
// [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
// [[1,1],[2,1]]
// [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

//Output
// [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
// [[1,1],[2,1]]
// [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
